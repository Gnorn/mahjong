A Mahjong tournament software

Quick overview before a more detailed readme is available: this allows you to run a mahjong tournament (or other 4-player games) by importing a table map, creating players, inputing results and penalties, and getting a ranking. Dynamic placement and ranking (depending on the result of players during the previous rounds for placement, and allowing for advanced calculation methods for ranking) is also available.
